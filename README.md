### Step 2: Backend Setup

**1. Create Project Folder**
```bash
mkdir placement-system
cd placement-system
```


**3. Copy `pom.xml`** (from project-structure.txt file)

**4. Configure Database** - Edit `src/main/resources/application.properties`:
```properties
# Database
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/placement_tracking
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD

# JWT Secret (Change this!)
jwt.secret=YourVerySecretKey256BitsOrMore_ChangeInProduction
jwt.expiration=86400000

# Email (Optional - for notifications)
spring.mail.host=smtp.gmail.com
spring.mail.port=587
spring.mail.username=your-email@gmail.com
spring.mail.password=your-app-password
```

**5. Build & Run**
```bash
# Build project (downloads dependencies - first time takes 5-10 minutes)
mvn clean install

# Run application
mvn spring-boot:run
```

✅ **Success!** You should see: `Started PlacementTrackingApplication in X seconds`

Backend is now running at: **http://localhost:8080**

2. Or use a simple server:
```bash
npx http-server
```
